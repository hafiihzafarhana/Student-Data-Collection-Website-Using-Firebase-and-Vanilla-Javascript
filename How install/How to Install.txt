In addition, firebase database usage is run online.
The firebase website can be visited via the following link:
https://firebase.google.com/

Program website berjalan dengan firebase versi 9.6.9

To run the website privately, the owner will not provide the owner's own "firebase configuration" details for fear of being misused (Prohibited 
to spread). The result if spread is that the website system will be changed by people who will abuse. Before getting a way to get "firebase configuration"
On your own, here's how:

1 Visit the firebase website with the link: https://firebase.google.com/

2 Get started

3 select add project (Do some options in creating a project)

4 After, through the project creation process, the user will be taken to the firebase dashboard

5 Select the "Project Overview" menu and select "+ Add app"

6 Then select for "web"

7 Fill out the form correctly according to the desired choice

8 At the Firebase SDk Add dropdown it is a "firebase configuration"

9 After getting "firebase configuration". Then, go back to the firebase dashboard and select the "Authentication" menu and select "Sign-in method"

10 Select "Add new provider"

11 Select "Email/Password" as authentication user who wants to login or register into the website

12 After that access the "Realtime Database" menu and select Rules

13 Change the rules on the "Realtime Database":
   The addition of "DataAnak":{".indexPn" = "nilai_akhir"} is used on the index page.html to get the 3 children with the highest score
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    "DataAnak":{
      ".indexOn": "nilai_akhir"
    }
  }
}

14 After that access the "Storage" menu (to save the uploaded image) and select rules

15 Change the rules on "Storage":
rules_version = '2';
firebase.storage service {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth == null;
    }
  }
}

16 Input "firebase configuration" into a script type "module"


Notes: 

1 Owners use firebase version 9.6.9. However, it has now evolved to version 9.6.10. This is an option determined by each other's wishes. 
However, users cannot combine 2 versions in 1 project. As in the index file.html use version 9.6.9 and in the home file.html use version 9.6.10. 
This causes an error.

2 Database does not need to be created by yourself because it will be created automatically if the user does CRUD on the website.
